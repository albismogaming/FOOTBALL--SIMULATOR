# FOOTBALL----SIMULATOR
Basic football simulator using python and object oriented programming.

Welcome to the Football Simulator Project! 
This project aims to create a dynamic and interactive simulation of football games, allowing users to experience the thrill of making strategic decisions, executing plays, and leading their team to victory. 
Built with Python, our simulator focuses on providing a realistic and engaging representation of football matches, complete with all the complexities and excitement of the real game.

# How It Works
The simulator runs through a console interface, presenting users with options at each step of the game. 
The current state of the game, including score, time left, down, and distance, is displayed, allowing users to make informed decisions. 
The outcome of each play is calculated based on a mix of probability, strategy, and the current game situation.

# Starting a Game
To start a game, users select two teams and then proceed to the kickoff. 
The game flow alternates between the offensive team choosing plays and the defensive team choosing their setup, with special teams plays for kickoffs, punts, and field goals.

# Making Decisions
During each offensive drive, users decide between running the ball, passing, or other strategic options. 
On defense, users anticipate the opponent's play choice and select their defensive strategy accordingly. *#*
Timeouts and end-of-quarter decisions add another layer of strategy, particularly in close games.

# Contributing
We welcome contributions from the football and coding communities!
